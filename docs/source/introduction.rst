Introduction
============

Welcome to the Metaproteomics Practical Workshop! In this 1.5-hour session, you will learn the basic steps involved in metaproteomic data analysis, from raw data conversion to result inspection. This hands-on workshop is designed to introduce you to essential tools and techniques used in the field.

Metaproteomics is the large-scale study of proteins from environmental samples composed of complex microbial communities. It often combines proteomics and metagenomics to identify and quantify proteins, providing insights into the functional dynamics of microbial ecosystems.
