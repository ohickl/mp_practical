**Q: What is the purpose of adding the human proteome and contaminant database to the metagenomic database?**

A: Including the human proteome accounts for potential human proteins that may contaminate environmental samples, especially in clinical or human-associated studies. The contaminant database includes common contaminants like keratins and trypsin, helping to identify and remove these from the analysis.

**Q: How does adjusting the FDR threshold impact the results?**

A: Lowering the FDR threshold (e.g., from 5% to 1%) makes the identification criteria more stringent, reducing the number of false positives but potentially missing true positives. Adjusting the threshold allows you to balance sensitivity and specificity.

**Q: Why do we need to convert the raw file before analysis?**

A: Converting the raw file to an open format like `.ms2` allows compatibility with various bioinformatics tools and ensures that the data can be processed on different platforms.
